"""
2.1. Generate ablated full images using various albumentation ablation sweeps.

Utilizes the AblationRunner class to manage image loading, ablation application,
and saving of ablated images.
Uses pre-defined ablation sweeps from sweeps.py (parameters that vary and
are fixed across sweep are determined there, but the variant parameter
value is still be adjusted here). Please refer to sweeps.py for details.
